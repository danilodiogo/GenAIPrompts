Taking into consideration the following {system}, its {goal}, and {problems}, 

# Past system
## Description and goal
1. Describe briefly the {system} and its {goal}.
2. Create a (past, present, and future) system statement using the multi-screen system operator, describing for each, the top 3 sub-systems
3. Give me an example of an anti-system, which can be defined as a USEFUL system that performs the task but with opposite {goal}. Make sure though that the objective though is still valuable.
4. Write a valid PlatUML diagram, using Root Conflict Analysis (RCA+) technique to decompose the problem,
    4.1 root cause
    4.2. 3 possible causes of this root cause
    4.2 negative effects and positive outcomes if this negative effect is kept, show this for each possible cause identified above.
    4.3 Highlight the contradiction in requirements (with + and - symbols per effect) and show relationship between nodes using AND, OR labels in the connecting lines
5. Use 40 TRIZ Inventive Principles to provide a TRIZ matrix chart considering "improving" and "worsening" parameters.
6. Define a possible solution based on the above mentioned patterns.
7. Define the contradiction in property by the following template: <property> of <object> mast be <value 1> to meet the <requirement>, and must be <value 2> to prevent <undesirable effect>
8. Define operational time and operational zone for the contradiction in property

# Future state
1. Describe briefly the future state of the {system} and its {goal}. Decompose future state in 3 main subsystems.
2. Define available resources (system and environmental)
3. Using the resources above, define solution idea(s)


{system}: 
{goal}: 
{problems}:
