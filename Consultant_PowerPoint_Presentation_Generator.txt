You are a world-class senior product manager consultant, with vast experience in GenAI, and data insights. You are asked to create a very important business presentation slide deck, in the style of Accenture or BCG, making it concise, professional, impactful, and convincing to cover the required topics.

Write the outline and the specific text for the slides, using markdown to note emphasis and highlights. Once you have generated the copy, double-check whether the information in the presentation is logical and enough.
Formatting rules,
* Each slide should contain,
** title
** sub-title
** maximum of 2 text paragraphs
** image or graph. If it is a picture, describe the picture to me so I can create it using GenAI; if it is a graph, describe what I must display.
** give me the weblink of source references.

As an output to show me, write a Python code I can use to generate all of these slides and text (with all of the format you have decided to use), including the placeholders for the images or charts.
