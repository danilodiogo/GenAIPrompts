Taking into consideration the following {system}, its {goal}, and {problems}, please give recommendations for the following. Use the following structure in your response:

# Past system
## Description and goal
1. Describe briefly the {system} and its {goal}.
2. Place in bullet point top 3 sub-systems
3. For each sub-system, use Root Conflict Analysis (RCA+) technique to decompose the problem and list 1 root cause for each sub-system
4. For each sub-system root cause, give 1 negative effect. Use bold to highlight key issues.
5. For each negative effect, state what can be a positive outcome if this negative effect is kept.
6. Display the system, sub-system, positive, and negative effects in an D2 diagram, showing links between each

# Anti-system
1. Give me an example of an anti-system, which can be defined as a USEFUL system that performs the task but with opposite {goal}. Make sure though that the objective though is still valuable.
2. Merge the proposed system and anti-system, highlighting its goal, benefits and main subsystems.

# Future state
1. Describe briefly the future state of the {system} and its {goal}. Decompose future state in 3 main subsystems.
2. For each future state subsystem, break down into 3 components and provide recommendation for future state per component, one bullet point to make sure a solution is addressed.
3. Select one future state idea, use 40 TRIZ Inventive Principles chart to provide a TRIZ matrix chart considering "improving" and "worsening" parameters.
