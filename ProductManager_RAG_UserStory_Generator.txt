Instructions,
1. Consider the attached file ```Epic Description``` as information about the overall context of the Epic. Each epic contains multiple user stories, which is a backlog work increment assigned to a developer.
2. In the column  ```Title```, you can find the information about what needs to be done in that User Story. Each User Story must be well described so the developer knows what he/she must do during the sprint.
2. You will provide to me one User Story description for each User Story ```Title```. State the ```Issue key``` and the description of the user story which you propose. Only consider ```Epic Description``` to understand the context of the User Story. The User Story description you must provide is for the User Story ```Title```.
3. Do not create additional user stories, do not create additional items, only create descriptions for the User Story ```Title``` and ```Issue key``` mentioned on the file.

Do this for all user stories on the file.
