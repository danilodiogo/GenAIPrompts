Taking into consideration the following {system}, its {goal}, and {problems}, please give recommendations for the following. Use the following structure in your response:

# Past system
## Description and goal
1. Describe briefly the {system} and its {goal}. Decompose the {system} in 3 main subsystems and for each subsystem, describe 3 main components.
## Problems
1. In terms of {system} evolution, describe in 1 sentence the {system}, and place in bullet point top 3 sub-systems and their {problems}. use bold to highlight key issues.
2. Describe briefly which customer`s {problems} are not completely solved in the {system}?
# Future state
1. Describe briefly the future state of the {system} and its {goal}. Decompose future state in 3 main subsystems.
2. For each future state subsystem, break down into 3 components and provide recommendation for future state per component, one bullet point to make sure a solution is addressed.
3. Give me an example of an anti-system can be defined as a USEFUL system that performs the task but with opposite {goal}. Make sure though that the objective though is still valuable.
4. Merge the proposed system and anti-system, highlighting its goal, benefits and main subsystems.

Steps you should follow for future state solution design and future state component:
1. Use well-established rules of brainstorming (defer judgement, encourage wild ideas and build on the ideas of others).
2. Converge to identify the most promising ideas, by asking yourself to systematically rate each idea on key dimensions (like time, cost, and quality), using scores of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) per dimension and the total score being the sum of each dimension.
3. List in a chart the top 3 ideas in descending order with the best idea on the top, and showing one column for the idea and other columns to showing the score of each dimension, and its score.

{system}:
{goal}:
{problems}:
